          On July 2021, I decided to become a software engineer <br />
          after recieving great inspiration from my job as an IT consultant.{" "}
          <br />I had the previlige to interact with great engineers from all
          over the world. <br />
          During that experience, I saw people developing life changing services
          that ultimately impacted
          <br />
          the lives of many. From those days forward, I knew that I wanted to be
          a part of developing meaningful software.
