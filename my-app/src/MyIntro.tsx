            I embarked on my journey with coding because I was deeply inspired
            by my previous role as an IT consultant. Through my interactions
            with software engineers from around the globe, I was struck by the
            incredible impact that their work had, and I was motivated to become
            a creator of services myself. I wanted to be a part of something
            bigger and more meaningful.

              Through the program, I really fell in love with building
